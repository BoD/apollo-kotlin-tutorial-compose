# Apollo Kotlin Tutorial

This is the tutorial application for working with the [Apollo Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin).

The tutorial is available through our documentation site: [Android Tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/tutorial/00-introduction/).

For copy errors in the tutorial, please file bugs against the main [`apollo-android` repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin). For broken code, please file issues on this repo.

This repo has two branches:

* [main](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin-tutorial/tree/main) is the final state of the application with all functionality
* [initial](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin-tutorial/tree/initial) is the starter project with the boilerplate and UI code already written but no Apollo Kotlin code.
